In software engineering, a design pattern is a reusable solution to a common problem in software design. Design patterns provide a way to standardize and document common design solutions to recurring problems, making it easier to communicate and collaborate on software development projects.

There are many different design patterns, each addressing a specific type of problem. Some common examples of design patterns include:

1. Singleton pattern: Ensures that only one instance of a class is created, and provides a global point of access to that instance.

2. Factory pattern: Provides an interface for creating objects in a super class, while allowing subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

3. Observer pattern: Allows objects to be notified automatically of changes to other objects.

4. Decorator pattern: Allows behavior to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.

Design patterns are not specific to any one programming language, and can be applied in a wide variety of situations. They can be especially useful for solving problems that are not easily addressed with standard programming techniques. However, it's important to use design patterns judiciously, as overusing them can make code more complex and difficult to understand.
